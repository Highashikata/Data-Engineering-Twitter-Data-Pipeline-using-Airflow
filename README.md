# Data-Engineering-Twitter-Data-Pipeline-using-Airflow

In this project we will use this architecture ![image](https://github.com/Highashikata/Data-Engineering-Twitter-Data-Pipeline-using-Airflow/assets/96960411/3e42197d-bef8-468d-b4e7-6ccc1af9497c)
in order to build a data pipeline by extarcting data from twitter using the ```tweepy``` which is Python API that enables us to connect to Twitter.

So we are going to get data from Twitter and transform it in Airflow using Python (Deployed in AWS EC2 instance) and then stored in the AWS S3.

We will begin by creating an account in X(ex Twitter) then go to [Twitter Developper Portal](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/platform](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/projects))
in order to create our project and apps.

After creating the app we will need to save these keys locally in a secure folder :
- **API key**
- **API key Secret**
- **Access Token**
- **Access Token Secret**
